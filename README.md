FELT is an experimental internet art platform and artist collective. Its IRL and URL experiences examine digital activism, hip hop culture, race, gender, and class. Since the start of FELT in 2011 the collective has grown from a small group of like-minded creatives to an international movement which spans the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Africa.
